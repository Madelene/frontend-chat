# FrontendChat

* To run this app locally, run server with this command: `hivemind Procfile.dev` and nagivate to `http://localhost:5000/`

* Production: `https://frontend-chat.herokuapp.com/`

* A component generator was created in `/lib/generators/component_generator.rb`, so it is possible to generate
your own components by running `rails g component NAME`

* Database is PostgreSQL

* Shout-out to Evil Martians for teaching me how to build this!
